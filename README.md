# Microcomputer Design

In this project, I designed and built a single-board microcomputer using a Motorola 68000 microprocessor and a Xilinx 9572 CPLD. 

I ordered my parts, made my schematic, designed a PCB, soldered the hardware, wrote the VHDL firmware, and wrote a 68k monitor program. 

Also included is an example 68k program which I compiled into an S-record to run on my microcomputer.
